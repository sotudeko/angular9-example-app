                        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        1. Definitions.

                        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                        
                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                        
                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
                        
                        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
                        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
                        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
                        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
                        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
                        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
                        
                        Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                        intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                        licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
                        wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
                        
                        Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                        the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                        copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                        the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                        reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                        respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

                        consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
                        Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

                        specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
                        Rights.

                        e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
                        any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
                        that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
                        
                        f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
                        or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
                        License.

                        dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
                        available to the public including in ways that members of the
                        public may access the material from a place and at a time
                        individually chosen by them.

                        resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

                        Section 2 -- Scope.
                        
                        a. License grant.
                        
                        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                        the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
                        
                        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                        in part; and
                        
                        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
                        
                        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                        License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                        its terms and conditions.
                        
                        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                        6(a).
                        
                        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                        all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                        and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                        necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                        simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                        (4) never produces Adapted Material.
                        
                        5. Downstream recipients.
                        
                        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                        recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                        Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                        Public License.
                        
                        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                        any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                        apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                        Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                        Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                        Material.
                        
                        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                        may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                        are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                        with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                        the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                        provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
                        
                        b. Other rights.
                        
                        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                        licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                        the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                        assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                        extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                        Rights, but not otherwise.
                        
                        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                        Public License.
                        
                        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                        under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                        licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                        reserves any right to collect such royalties.
                        
                        
                        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
                        
                        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
                        following conditions.
                        
                        a. Attribution.
                        
                        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                        form), You must:
                        
                        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                        with the Licensed Material:
                        
                        i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);
                        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
                        
                        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
                        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                        warranties;
                        
                        v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                        extent reasonably practicable;
                        
                        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                        retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
                        
                        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                        Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                        hyperlink to, this Public License.
                        
                        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                        reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                        information.
                        
                        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                        information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                        reasonably practicable.
                        
                        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
                        License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
                        Material from complying with this Public License.
                        
                        
                        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
                        
                        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
                        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
                        
                        a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
                        to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
                        portion of the contents of the database;
                        
                        b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
                        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
                        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
                        
                        c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
                        all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
                        
                        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
                        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
                        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
                        
                        
                        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
                        
                        a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
                        EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
                        AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
                        ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
                        IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                        WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
                        ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
                        KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
                        ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                        
                        b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
                        TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
                        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
                        COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
                        USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
                        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
                        DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
                        IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                        
                        c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
                        above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
                        possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
                        waiver of all liability.
                        
                        
                        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
                        
                        a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
                        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
                        this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
                        terminate automatically.
                        
                        b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
                        Section 6(a), it reinstates:
                        
                        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                        violation; or
                        
                        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
                        
                        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
                        right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
                        of this Public License.
                        
                        c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
                        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
                        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
                        will not terminate this Public License.
                        
                        d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
                        License.
                        
                        
                        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
                        
                        a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
                        terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
                        
                        b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
                        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
                        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
                        
                        
                        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
                        
                        a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
                        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
                        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
                        be made without permission under this Public License.
                        
                        b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
                        deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
                        minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
                        cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
                        without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
                        conditions.
                        
                        c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
                        failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
                        Licensor.
                        
                        d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
                        as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
                        that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
                        processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

                        reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
                        efforts of others.
                        
                        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
                        of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
                        Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
                        and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
                        and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
                        effect of CC0 on those rights.
                        
                        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
                        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
                        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
                        to, the following:
                        
                        i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
                        and translate a Work;
                        
                        ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
                        
                        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
                        depicted in a Work;
                        
                        iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
                        subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
                        
                        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
                        a Work;
                        
                        vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                        European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
                        protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
                        including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
                        
                        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
                        based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
                        
                        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
                        applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
                        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
                        and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
                        known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
                        action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
                        duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
                        extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
                        copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
                        commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
                        the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
                        detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
                        shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
                        any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
                        by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
                        
                        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
                        judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
                        shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
                        is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
                        non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
                        unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
                        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
                        provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                        in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
                        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
                        promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
                        of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
                        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
                        applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
                        invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
                        affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
                        and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
                        
                        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
                        
                        a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                        surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
                        
                        b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
                        of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
                        including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
                        for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
                        other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
                        discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
                        
                        c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                        that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
                        any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
                        disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
                        or other rights required for any use of the Work.
                        
                        d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
                        party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
                        CC0 or use of the Work.

                        Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
                        and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
                        and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
                        effect of CC0 on those rights.
                        
                        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
                        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
                        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
                        to, the following:
                        
                        i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
                        and translate a Work;
                        
                        ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
                        
                        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
                        depicted in a Work;
                        
                        iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
                        subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
                        
                        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
                        a Work;
                        
                        vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                        European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
                        protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
                        including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
                        
                        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
                        based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
                        
                        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
                        applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
                        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
                        and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
                        known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
                        action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
                        duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
                        extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
                        copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
                        commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
                        the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
                        detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
                        shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
                        any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
                        by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
                        
                        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
                        judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
                        shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
                        is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
                        non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
                        unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
                        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
                        provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                        in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
                        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
                        promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
                        of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
                        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
                        applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
                        invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
                        affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
                        and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
                        
                        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
                        
                        a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                        surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
                        
                        b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
                        of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
                        including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
                        for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
                        other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
                        discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
                        
                        c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                        that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
                        any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
                        disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
                        or other rights required for any use of the Work.
                        
                        d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
                        party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
                        CC0 or use of the Work.

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

                        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                        
                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                        
                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                        
                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                        
                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                        
                        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                        
                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.

                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.
                        
                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:
                        
                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                        
                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and
                        
                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and
                        
                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.
                        
                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.
                        
                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                        
                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                        
                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                        
                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                        
                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                        
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

                    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
                    GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.
                    
                    The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
                    understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
                    Forge project.
                    
                    If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
                    that license.
                    
                    You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
                    you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
                    use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
                    left intact.
                    
                    If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
                    commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
                    afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
                    library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
                    the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
                    thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
                    the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
                    commercial entities for our efforts.

                    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
                    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
                    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                    
                    Preamble
                    
                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.
                    
                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                    
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                    
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                    
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.
                    
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.
                    
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
                    
                    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
                    modification follow.
                    
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
                    
                    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
                    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
                    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
                    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
                    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                    
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
                    
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                    
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                    
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                    
                    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                    
                    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                    parties under the terms of this License.
                    
                    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                    
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
                    
                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                    
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                    
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                    
                    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    
                    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                    customarily used for software interchange; or,
                    
                    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such
                    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                    
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                    
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                    
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                    
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                    
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                    
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                    
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                    
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                    
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                    
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                    
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                    
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                    
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                    
                    NO WARRANTY
                    
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
                    
                    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
                    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
                    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
                    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
                    Database section 7.
                    
                    # 7.  Database Ownership
                    #
                    #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
                    #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
                    #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
                    #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
                    #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
                    #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
                    #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
                    #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
                    #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
                    #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
                    #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
                    #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
                    #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

                    Preamble
                    
                    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
                    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
                    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
                    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
                    Package available as open source and free software.
                    
                    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
                    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
                    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
                    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
                    a different licensing arrangement.
                    
                    Definitions
                    
                    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
                    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
                    
                    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
                    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
                    procedures.
                    
                    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
                    distribute, or modify the Package.
                    
                    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
                    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
                    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
                    Version, or a Modified Version.
                    
                    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
                    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
                    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
                    
                    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
                    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
                    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
                    
                    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
                    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
                    by the Copyright Holder.
                    
                    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
                    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
                    Holder.
                    
                    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
                    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
                    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
                    
                    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
                    configuration files for the Package.
                    
                    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
                    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                    translation of the Source form.
                    
                    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
                    
                    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
                    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
                    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
                    
                    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
                    
                    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
                    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
                    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
                    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
                    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
                    Compiled form of the Package.
                    
                    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
                    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
                    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
                    will be subject to the Original License.
                    
                    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
                    
                    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
                    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
                    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
                    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
                    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
                    you do at least ONE of the following:
                    
                    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
                    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                    Version.
                    
                    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
                    from the name of the Standard Version.
                    
                    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
                    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
                    under
                    
                    (i)  the Original License or
                    
                    (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
                    modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
                    licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                    received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                    Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                    available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
                    Fees are allowed.
                    
                    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
                    or Modified Versions without the Source
                    
                    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
                    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
                    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
                    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
                    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
                    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
                    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
                    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
                    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
                    
                    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
                    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
                    the Source of the Modified Version.
                    
                    Aggregating or Linking the Package
                    
                    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
                    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
                    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
                    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
                    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
                    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
                    as included in the aggregation.
                    
                    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
                    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
                    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
                    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
                    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
                    
                    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
                    
                    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
                    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
                    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
                    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
                    terms of this license.
                    
                    General Provisions
                    
                    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
                    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
                    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
                    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
                    license.
                    
                    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
                    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
                    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
                    this license.
                    
                    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
                    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
                    
                    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
                    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
                    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
                    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
                    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
                    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
                    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
                    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
                    date that such litigation is filed.
                    
                    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
                    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
                    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
                    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR

                    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
                    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
                    1. Definitions.
                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
                    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
                    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
                    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
                    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                    1. Definitions.
                    
                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                    
                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    1. Definitions.
                    
                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                    
                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

                    6. Trademarks.

                    1. Definitions.
                    
                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                    
                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
                    
                    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
                    
                    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
                    
                    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
                    
                    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                    
                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS]]>

                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
                    owner that is granting the License.

                    that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
                    For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
                    indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
                    contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
                    available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
                    in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
                    is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,

                    original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
                    shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
                    name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                    by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
                    on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
                    "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                    issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
                    the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
                    that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
                    owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
                    of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently

                    2. Grant of Copyright License.
                    
                    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
                    grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
                    Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License.
                    
                    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
                    grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
                    made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
                    such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
                    that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
                    of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
                    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
                    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
                    for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution.
                    
                    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
                    in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
                    provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
                    this License; and
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
                    changed the files; and
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
                    all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
                    of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
                    Derivative Works; and
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
                    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
                    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
                    following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
                    Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
                    with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
                    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
                    License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
                    You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
                    provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
                    modifying the License.
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
                    additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
                    distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
                    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                    with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions.
                    
                    Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
                    for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
                    conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
                    any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
                    such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks.
                    
                    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
                    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
                    reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
                    
                    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
                    Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
                    including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
                    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
                    solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
                    redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability.
                    
                    In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
                    contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
                    and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
                    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
                    out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
                    damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
                    any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
                    been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
                    
                    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
                    offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
                    other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
                    in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
                    sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
                    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
                    accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
                    notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
                    identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
                    enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
                    recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on
                    the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within
                    third-party archives.

                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

                    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                    
                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
                    
                    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                    the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                    identification within third-party archives.

                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:
                    
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                    as modifying the License.
                    
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
                    
                    1. Definitions.
                    
                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                    
                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.
                    
                    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
                    
                    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
                    
                    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
                    
                    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                    
                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                    
                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
                    
                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                    
                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
                    
                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
                    
                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    
                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
                    
                    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                    
                    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                    
                    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                    
                    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
                    
                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    
                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    
                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
                    
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
